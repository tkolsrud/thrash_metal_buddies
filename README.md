First SEI project - create a tomagotchi

Project Name: Thrash Metal Pet Game

Objectives:
- The user will create a pet guitarist. They will feed the guitarist beer, make them practice, and allow them to vent by trashing their dressing room. If any of these metrics are not regulated the guitarist will quit the band and go back to school.

UI:
- The user will be greeted with a window prompting them to name their guitarist, and set the guitarist's age.
- After they have named their guitarist they will be taken to the main screen:
  - The main screen will consist of their guitarist, three progress bars - oriented vertically to the left and right of the guitarist, and three corresponding           buttons.
  - In the top right of the window there will be an "Age: " ticker.

Gameplay:
- On the left of the guitarist the user will see the "Beer Level" bar, and the "Chops Level" Bar. Each of these will start completely filled, and then lower at set increments.
- On the right of the guitarist will be the "Rage Level" bar, which will start completely empty, and then fill at set increments
- Under the "Beer Level" bar there will be a "Drink" button, which will raise the "Beer Level" at set increments. The button will also trigger an animation on the guitarist avatar
- Under the "Chops Level" bar there will be a "Practice" button, which raise the "Chops Level" at set increments. The button will also trigger an animation on the guitarist avatar.
- Under the "Rage Level" bar there will be a "Trash Dressing Room" button, which will lower the "Rage Level" at set increments. The button will also trigger an animation on the guitarist avatar.
- As the game progresses the number displayed in the "Age: " ticker will increase at set increments.
- There will be a transformation function that occurs after a set interval. This will trigger an animation, as well as change the photo of the guitarist avatar.
- If either the "Beer Level" or "Chops Level" bars reach zero, or the "Rage Level Bar" hits ten, a window will appear informing the user that their guitarist has gotten bored and returned to school.
